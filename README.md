### Instructions for creating a new talk proposal

To propose a talk create a new issue [here](https://github.com/soaipune/Talks/issues)

Please include the following points in your issue:
* The title of the issue should be the same as the title of the talk.
* Please give an introductory background of the title/topic
* Mention the points you would like to cover in your talk
* Also do share the goal of your talk and how it will help the audience

If you need any help in planning the above points we would love to discuss it in the issue. We can't wait to see what you can present!
